	abstract = {An important finding in the cognitive effort literature has been that sensitivity to the costs of effort varies between individuals, suggesting that some people  find effort more aversive than others. It has been suggested this may explain  individual differences in other aspects of cognition; in particular that greater  effort sensitivity may underlie some of the symptoms of conditions such as  depression and schizophrenia. In this paper, we highlight a major problem with  existing measures of cognitive effort that hampers this line of research,  specifically the confounding of effort and difficulty. This means that behaviour  thought to reveal effort costs could equally be explained by cognitive capacity,  which influences the frequency of success and thereby the chance of obtaining  reward. To address this shortcoming, we introduce a new test, the Number  Switching Task (NST), specially designed such that difficulty will be unaffected  by the effort manipulation and can easily be standardised across participants. In  a large, online sample, we show that these criteria are met successfully and  reproduce classic effort discounting results with the NST. We also demonstrate  the use of Bayesian modelling with this task, producing behavioural parameters  which can be associated with other measures, and report a preliminary association  with the Need for Cognition scale.},

	abstract = {Most psychiatric disorders do not occur in isolation, and most psychiatric symptom dimensions are not uniquely expressed within a single diagnostic  category. Current treatments fail to work for around 25\% to 40\% of individuals,  perhaps due at least in part to an overreliance on diagnostic categories in  treatment development and allocation. In this review, we describe ongoing efforts  in the field to surmount these challenges and precisely characterize psychiatric  symptom dimensions using large-scale studies of unselected samples via remote,  online, and "citizen science" efforts that take a dimensional, mechanistic  approach. We discuss the importance that efforts to identify meaningful  psychiatric dimensions be coupled with careful computational modeling to formally  specify, test, and potentially falsify candidate mechanisms that underlie  transdiagnostic symptom dimensions. We refer to this approach, i.e., where  symptom dimensions are identified and validated against computationally  well-defined neurocognitive processes, as computational factor modeling. We  describe in detail some recent applications of this method to understand  transdiagnostic cognitive processes that include model-based planning,  metacognition, appetitive processing, and uncertainty estimation. In this  context, we highlight how computational factor modeling has been used to identify  specific associations between cognition and symptom dimensions and reveal  previously obscured relationships, how findings generalize to smaller in-person  clinical and nonclinical samples, and how the method is being adapted and  optimized beyond its original instantiation. Crucially, we discuss next steps for  this area of research, highlighting the value of more direct investigations of  treatment response that bridge the gap between basic research and the clinic.},

Computational modelling of behaviour provides a mechanistic framework for  understanding the cognitive and neurobiological bases of fear and anxiety, and  has seen increasing interest in the field. In this brief review, we discuss  recent developments in the computational modelling of human fear and anxiety.  Firstly, we describe various reinforcement learning strategies that humans employ  when learning to predict or avoid threat, and how these relate to symptoms of  fear and anxiety. Secondly, we discuss initial efforts to explore, through a  computational lens, approach-avoidance conflict paradigms that are popular in  animal research to measure fear- and anxiety-relevant behaviours. Finally, we  discuss negative biases in decision-making in the face of uncertainty in anxiety.},

Bias modification aims to reduce these biases using  computerized training, but shows mixed success and has not been tested at scale.  The aim was to determine whether bias modification delivered via smartphones can  improve mood in a large sample. In total, 153 385 self-referring participants  were randomly assigned to modification or sham bias training on a dot-probe or  visual-search task. The primary outcome of interest was balance of mood, assessed  on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. In total, 22 933 participants who  provided at least two mood ratings were included in analyses. There was a large  amount of participant attrition. In the remaining smaller sample, results  supported the prediction that visual-search modification would result in improved  mood (95\%CI [0.10, 0.82]; p = 0.01, d = 0.05, N = 2588 after two ratings; 95\%CI  [1.75,6.54]; p = 0.001, d = 0.32, N = 118 after six ratings), which was not seen  for the sham version (N = 4818 after two ratings; N = 138 after six ratings).  Dot-probe modification was not associated with mood improvements (p = 0.52).  Visual-search, but not dot-probe, bias modification slightly but significantly  improved mood. Although this effect size is very small and subject to large  participant drop-off, it might be worth considering an adjunct to current  treatments.},

Prior research has implicated a  relationship between individual differences in trait anxiety/vigilance,  engagement of this circuitry, and anxiogenic features of the environment (e.g.,  through threat-of-shock and movie-watching). In the present study, we predicted  that-for those scoring high in self-reported anxiety and a behavioral measure of  threat vigilance-this circuitry is chronically engaged, even in the absence of  anxiogenic stimuli. Our analyses of resting-state fMRI data (N = 639) did not,  however, provide evidence for such a relationship. Nevertheless, in our planned  exploratory analyses, we saw a relationship between threat vigilance behavior  (but not self-reported anxiety) and intrinsic amygdala-periaqueductal gray  connectivity. Here, we suggest this subcortical circuitry may be chronically  engaged in hypervigilant individuals, but that amygdala-prefrontal circuitry may  only be engaged in response to anxiogenic stimuli.},

There is now an influx of research attempting  using these metrics within both laboratory settings (typically derived through  electrocardiography or pulse oximetry) and ecologically-rich contexts (via  wearable photoplethysmography, i.e., smartwatches). However, these signals can be  prone to artifacts and a low signal to noise ratio, which traditionally are  detected and removed through visual inspection. Here, we developed an open-source  Python package, RapidHRV, dedicated to the preprocessing, analysis, and  visualization of heart rate and heart rate variability. Each of these modules can  be executed with one line of code and includes automated cleaning. In simulated  data, RapidHRV demonstrated excellent recovery of heart rate across most levels  of noise ({\textgreater}=10 dB) and moderate-to-excellent recovery of heart rate variability  even at relatively low signal to noise ratios ({\textgreater}=20 dB) and sampling rates ({\textgreater}=20  Hz). Validation in real datasets shows good-to-excellent recovery of heart rate  and heart rate variability in electrocardiography and finger photoplethysmography  recordings. Validation in wrist photoplethysmography demonstrated RapidHRV  estimations were sensitive to heart rate and its variability under low motion  conditions, but estimates were less stable under higher movement settings.},

One possibility is that while amygdala activity underlies core  features of anxiety (e.g. detection of salient information), prefrontal cortices  (i.e. dorsomedial prefrontal/anterior cingulate cortex) entrain its  responsiveness. To date, this has been established in tightly controlled  paradigms (predominantly using static face perception tasks) but has not been  extended to more naturalistic settings. Consequently, using 'movie fMRI'-in which  participants watch ecologically-rich movie stimuli rather than constrained  cognitive tasks-we sought to test whether individual differences in anxiety  correlate with the degree of face-dependent amygdala-prefrontal coupling in two  independent samples. Analyses suggested increased face-dependent superior  parietal activation and decreased speech-dependent auditory cortex activation as  a function of anxiety. However, we failed to find evidence for anxiety-dependent  connectivity, neither in our stimulus-dependent or -independent analyses. Our  findings suggest that work using experimentally constrained tasks may not  replicate in more ecologically valid settings and, moreover, highlight the  importance of testing the generalizability of neuroimaging findings outside of  the original context.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Computational psychiatry studies have investigated how reinforcement learning may be different in individuals with mood and anxiety disorders compared  with control individuals, but results are inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To assess  whether there are consistent differences in reinforcement-learning parameters  between patients with depression or anxiety and control individuals. DATA  SOURCES: Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar searches were  performed between November 15, 2019, and December 6, 2019, and repeated on  December 3, 2020, and February 23, 2021, with keywords (reinforcement learning)  AND (computational OR model) AND (depression OR anxiety OR mood). STUDY  SELECTION: Studies were included if they fit reinforcement-learning models to  human choice data from a cognitive task with rewards or punishments, had a  case-control design including participants with mood and/or anxiety disorders and  healthy control individuals, and included sufficient information about all  parameters in the models. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Articles were assessed  for inclusion according to MOOSE guidelines. Participant-level parameters were  extracted from included articles, and a conventional meta-analysis was performed  using a random-effects model. Subsequently, these parameters were used to  simulate choice performance for each participant on benchmarking tasks in a  simulation meta-analysis. Models were fitted, parameters were extracted using  bayesian model averaging, and differences between patients and control  individuals were examined. Overall effect sizes across analytic strategies were  inspected. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were estimated  reinforcement-learning parameters (learning rate, inverse temperature, reward  learning rate, and punishment learning rate). RESULTS: A total of 27 articles  were included (3085 participants, 1242 of whom had depression and/or anxiety). In  the conventional meta-analysis, patients showed lower inverse temperature than  control individuals (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.215; 95\% CI, -0.354  to -0.077), although no parameters were common across all studies, limiting the  ability to infer differences. In the simulation meta-analysis, patients showed  greater punishment learning rates (SMD, 0.107; 95\% CI, 0.107 to 0.108) and  slightly lower reward learning rates (SMD, -0.021; 95\% CI, -0.022 to -0.020)  relative to control individuals. The simulation meta-analysis showed no  meaningful difference in inverse temperature between patients and control  individuals (SMD, 0.003; 95\% CI, 0.002 to 0.004). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The  simulation meta-analytic approach introduced in this article for inferring  meta-group differences from heterogeneous computational psychiatry studies  indicated elevated punishment learning rates in patients compared with control  individuals. This difference may promote and uphold negative affective bias  symptoms and hence constitute a potential mechanistic treatment target for mood  and anxiety disorders.},

However,  it can be caused by wide range of possible underlying cognitive mechanisms. Here  we illustrate this by focusing on one particular behavioural signature of  affective bias - increased tendency of anxious/depressed individuals to predict  lower rewards - in the context of the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) modelling  framework. Specifically, we show how to apply this framework to measure affective  bias and compare it to the behaviour of an optimal observer. We also show how to  extend the framework to make predictions about bias when the individual holds  incorrect assumptions about the decision context. Building on this theoretical  foundation, we propose five experiments to test five hypothetical sources of this  affective bias: beliefs about prior probabilities, beliefs about performance,  subjective value of reward, learning differences, and need for accuracy  differences. We argue that greater precision about the mechanisms driving  affective bias may eventually enable us to better understand the mechanisms  underlying mood and anxiety disorders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are leading causes of disability worldwide, yet individuals are often unable to access appropriate treatment. There is a need  to develop effective interventions that can be delivered remotely. Previous  research has suggested that emotional processing biases are a potential target  for intervention, and these may be altered through brief training programs.  METHODS: We report two experimental medicine studies of emotional bias training  in two samples: individuals from the general population (n = 522) and individuals  currently taking antidepressants to treat anxiety or depression (n = 212).  Participants, recruited online, completed four sessions of EBT from their own  home. Mental health and cognitive functioning outcomes were assessed at baseline,  immediately post-training, and at 2-week follow-up. RESULTS: In both studies, our  intervention successfully trained participants to perceive ambiguous social  information more positively. This persisted at a 2-week follow-up. There was no  clear evidence that this change in emotional processing transferred to  improvements in symptoms in the primary analyses. However, in both studies, there  was weak evidence for improved quality of life following EBT amongst individuals  with more depressive symptoms at baseline. No clear evidence of transfer effects  was observed for self-reported daily stress, anhedonia or depressive symptoms.  Exploratory analyses suggested that younger participants reported greater  treatment gains. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of  delivering a multi-session online training program to promote lasting cognitive  changes. Given the inconsistent evidence for transfer effects, EBT requires  further development before it can be considered as a treatment for anxiety and  depression.},

However, the question of whether participants recruited into fMRI studies  differ from participants recruited into other study contexts has received little  to no attention. This is particularly pertinent when effects fail to generalize  across study contexts: for example, a behavioural effect discovered in a  non-imaging context not replicating in a neuroimaging environment. Here, we  tested the hypothesis, motivated by preliminary findings (N = 272), that fMRI  participants differ from behaviour-only participants on one fundamental  individual difference variable: trait anxiety. Analysing trait anxiety scores and  possible confounding variables from healthy volunteers across multiple  institutions (N = 3317), we found robust support for lower trait anxiety in fMRI  study participants, consistent with a sampling or self-selection bias. The bias  was larger in studies that relied on phone screening (compared with full  in-person psychiatric screening), recruited at least partly from convenience  samples (compared with community samples), and in pharmacology studies.

Using an online experiment with a large representative  British sample, we aimed to examine whether FOPLs improve participants' ability  to identify the healthiness of foods and drinks. The primary aim was to compare  ability to rank between FOPL groups and a no label control. Adults (≥18 years),  recruited from the NatCen panel, were randomised to one of five experimental  groups (Multiple Traffic Light, MTL; Nutri-Score, N-S; Warning Label, WL;  Positive Choice tick, PC; no label control). Stratification variables were year  of recruitment to panel, sex, age, government office region, and household  income. Packaging images were created for three versions, varying in healthiness,  of six food and drink products (pizza, drinks, cakes, crisps, yoghurts, breakfast  cereals). Participants were asked to rank the three product images in order of  healthiness. Ranking was completed on a single occasion and comprised a baseline  measure (with no FOPL), and a follow-up measure including the FOPL as per each  participant's experimental group. The primary outcome was the ability to  accurately rank product healthiness (all products ranked correctly vs. any  incorrect). In 2020, 4504 participants had complete data and were included in the  analysis. The probability of correct ranking at follow-up, and improving between  baseline and follow-up, was significantly greater across all products for the  N-S, MTL and WL groups, compared to control. This was seen for only some of the  products for the PC group. The largest effects were seen for N-S, followed by  MTL. These analyses were adjusted for stratification variables, ethnicity,  education, household composition, food shopping responsibility, and current FOPL  use. Exploratory analyses showed a tendency for participants with higher compared  to lower education to rank products more accurately. Conclusions: All FOPLs were  effective at improving participants' ability to correctly rank products according  to healthiness in this large representative British sample, with the largest  effects seen for N-S, followed by MTL.},

	abstract = {Anxiety and stress are adaptive responses to threat that promote harm avoidance. In particular, prior work has shown that anxiety induced in humans using threat  of unpredictable shock promotes behavioral inhibition in the face of harm. This  is consistent with the idea that anxiety promotes passive avoidance-that is,  withholding approach actions that could lead to harm. However, harm can also be  avoided through active avoidance, where a (withdrawal) action is taken to avoid  harm. Here, we provide the first direct within-study comparison of the effects of  threat of shock on active and passive avoidance. We operationalize passive  avoidance as withholding a button press response in the face of negative  outcomes, and active avoidance as lifting/releasing a button press in the face of  negative outcomes. We explore the impact of threat of unpredictable shock on the  learning of these behavioral responses (alongside matched responses to rewards)  within a single cognitive task. We predicted that threat of shock would promote  both active and passive avoidance, and that this would be driven by increased  reliance on Pavlovian bias, as parameterized within reinforcement-learning  models. Consistent with our predictions, we provide evidence that threat of shock  promotes passive avoidance as conceptualized by our task. However, inconsistent  with predictions, we found no evidence that threat of shock promoted active  avoidance, nor evidence of elevated Pavlovian bias in any condition. One  hypothetical framework with which to understand these findings is that anxiety  promotes passive over active harm avoidance strategies in order to conserve  energy while avoiding harm.},

SUMMARY: Overall, common currency tasks offer the  potential to improve drug discovery in psychiatry. We recommend that researchers  prioritise construct validity above face validity when designing common currency  tasks and suggest that the evidence for construct validity is summarised in  papers presenting research in this area.},

Here, we  therefore develop a novel, comprehensive self-report measure of general  catastrophizing. We performed five online studies (total n = 734), in which we  created and refined a Catastrophizing Questionnaire, and used a factor analytic  approach to understand its underlying structure. We also assessed convergent and  discriminant validity, and analysed test-retest reliability. Furthermore, we  tested the ability of Catastrophizing Questionnaire scores to predict relevant  clinical variables over and above other questionnaires. Finally, we also  developed a four-item short version of this questionnaire. We found that our  questionnaire is best fit by a single underlying factor, and shows convergent and  discriminant validity. Exploratory factor analyses indicated that catastrophizing  is independent from other related constructs, including anxiety and worry.  Moreover, we demonstrate incremental validity for this questionnaire in  predicting diagnostic and medication status. Finally, we demonstrate that our  Catastrophizing Questionnaire has good test-retest reliability (intraclass  correlation coefficient = 0.77, p {\textless} 0.001). Critically, we can now, for the first  time, obtain detailed self-report data on catastrophizing.},

In the present study  (N = 300), we bridged these two areas by investigating whether trait anxiety  correlated with metacognitive belief and-consequently-propensity to offload  information in a delayed intentions paradigm. Participants received a financial  reward based on their ability to remember targets. However, participants could  take a reduced reward per target if they decided to use reminders. We replicated  previous findings that participants were biased to use more reminders than would  be optimal, and this bias was correlated with metacognitive judgements. However,  we show no evidence that trait anxiety held a relationship with metacognitive  belief or reminder usage. Indeed, Bayesian analyses strongly favoured the null.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although anxiety can be an adaptive response to unpredictable threats, pathological anxiety disorders occur when symptoms adversely affect daily life.  Whether or not adaptive and pathological anxiety share mechanisms remains  unknown, but if they do, induced (adaptive) anxiety could be used as an  intermediate translational model of pathological anxiety to improve drug  development pipelines. The authors therefore compared meta-analyses of functional  neuroimaging studies of induced and pathological anxiety. METHODS: A systematic  search of the PubMed database was conducted in June 2019 for whole-brain  functional MRI articles. Eligible articles contrasted either anxious patients to  control subjects or an unpredictable-threat condition to a safe condition in  healthy participants. Five anxiety disorders were included: posttraumatic stress  disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder,  and specific phobia. A total of 3,433 records were identified, 181 articles met  selection criteria, and the largest subset of task type was emotional (N=138).  Seed-based d-mapping software was used for all analyses. RESULTS: Induced anxiety  (N=693 participants) and pathological anxiety (N=2,554 patients and 2,348 control  subjects) both showed increased activation in the left and right insula  (coordinates, 44, 14, -14 and -38, 20, -8; k=2,102 and k=1,305, respectively) and  cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex (-12, -8, 68; k=2,217). When the  analyses were split by disorder, specific phobia appeared the most, and  generalized anxiety disorder the least, similar to induced anxiety. CONCLUSIONS:  This meta-analysis indicates a consistent pattern of activation across induced  and pathological anxiety, supporting the proposition that some neurobiological  mechanisms overlap and that the former may be used as a model for the latter.  Induced anxiety might nevertheless be a better model for some anxiety disorders  than others.},

Prominent theories of anxiety suggest that the effect of anxiety on  cognition is due to anxious thoughts "overloading" limited cognitive resources,  competing with other processes. If this is so, then a cognitive load manipulation  should impact performance of a task in the same way as induced anxiety. Thus, we  examined the impact of a load manipulation on a time perception task that we have  previously shown to be reliably impacted by anxiety. In contrast with our  prediction, across 3 studies we found that time perception was insensitive to our  load manipulation. Our results do not therefore support the idea that anxiety  impacts temporal cognition by overloading limited cognitive resources, at least  as induced by a commonly used load manipulation. Thus, anxiety might affect  temporal cognition in a unique way, via an evolutionary-preserved defense  survival system, as suggested by animal-inspired theories of anxiety, rather than  competing for limited attentional resources.

However, prior work using cognitive tasks to measure  such biases is largely restricted to case-control group studies, which cannot be  used for inference about individuals without considerable additional validation.  Moreover, very few measures are fully translational (i.e., can be used across  animals and humans in treatment-development pipelines). This investigation aimed  to produce the first measure of negative cognitive biases that is both  translational and sensitive to individual differences, and then to determine  which specific self-reported psychiatric symptoms are related to bias. METHODS: A  total of 1060 (n = 990 complete) participants performed a cognitive task of  negative bias along with psychiatric symptom questionnaires. We tested the  hypothesis that individual levels of mood and anxiety disorder symptomatology  would covary positively with negative bias on the cognitive task using a  combination of computational modeling of behavior, confirmatory factor analysis,  exploratory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. RESULTS:  Participants with higher depression symptoms (β = -0.16, p = .017) who were older  (β = -0.11, p = .001) and had lower IQ (β = 0.14, p {\textless} .001) showed greater  negative bias. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling  suggested that no other psychiatric symptom (or transdiagnostic latent factor)  covaried with task performance over and above the effect of depression, while  exploratory factor analysis suggested combining depression/anxiety symptoms in a  single latent factor. Generating groups using symptom cutoffs or latent mixture  modeling recapitulated our prior case-control findings. CONCLUSIONS: This  measure, which uniquely spans both the clinical group-to-individual and  preclinical animal-to-human generalizability gaps, can be used to measure  individual differences in depression vulnerability for translational  treatment-development pipelines.},

However aversive  events can elicit at least two dissociable subtypes of reactions: fear (transient  and relating to an imminent event) and anxiety (diffuse and relating to an  unpredictable event). We hypothesised that anxiety might have an opposite effect  on time perception compared to fear. To test this we combined a robust anxiety  manipulation (threat-of-shock) with a widely used timing task in which  participants judged whether the duration of a stimulus was long or short. In line  with our hypothesis, across three experiments (with varying stimulus timings and  shock levels), participants significantly underestimated time under inducted  anxiety, as indicated by a rightward shift of the psychophysical function  (meta-analytic effect size: d = 0.68, 95\% confidence interval: 0.42-0.94). In two  further studies, we were unable to replicate previous findings that fear leads to  time overestimation, after adapting our temporal cognition task, which suggests a  dissociation between fear and anxiety on how they affect time perception. Our  results suggest that experimentally inducing anxiety leads to underestimating the  duration of temporal intervals, which might be a starting point in explaining  different subjective experiences of disorders related to fear (e.g.  post-traumatic stress disorder) and anxiety (e.g. generalised anxiety disorder).},

Recent work shows that the  impact of anxiety on memory depends on the context and memory modality. For  instance, threat of shock, a translational within-subject anxiety induction, has  been shown to impair the encoding of facial stimuli, while improving spatial  working memory (WM) accuracy. The present study aimed to delineate the neural  circuitry regulating these opposing behavioural effects. Thirty-three healthy  volunteers performed the previously assessed facial recognition and a spatial WM  tasks inside an fMRI scanner, under alternating within-subject conditions of  threat or safe from shock across encoding and retrieval. Facial recognition  impairments were replicated when threat was selectively induced at encoding.  Neuroimaging results suggest that this effect was driven by increased competition  for attentional resources within the anterior cingulate cortex, in which  activation correlated positively with stress levels. The impact of threat on  spatial WM performance did not, however, replicate in the fMRI environment.  Nevertheless, state-dependent hippocampal activation was observed in both tasks.  These findings suggest a neurocognitive mechanism by which anxiety impairs facial  recognition as well as a state-dependent hippocampal activation pattern, which  may putatively underline retrieval of negative experiences in anxiety.},

The assumption is that this is because  anxious individuals assume "worse" outcomes. However, predictions are often made  about high and low rewards, so it is not clear whether the bias is due to the  valence (the "worse" option) or just magnitude (the lower number). We therefore  explored the roles of valence and magnitude in a translational measure of  negative affective bias. We adapted a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC)  "reward-reward" task into a "punishment-punishment" paradigm, and followed up  with "high reward-high punishment" and "low reward-high punishment" variants. The  results from the "punishment-punishment" paradigm - a bias towards higher  punishments in healthy controls - suggest that it is outcome magnitude that is  important. However, this is qualified by the other variants which indicate that  both valence and magnitude are important.

In this article, we discuss the distinction between fear and anxiety,  before reviewing translational research on the neural circuitry of anxiety in  animal models and how it relates to human neuroimaging studies across both  healthy and clinical populations. We highlight the roles of subcortical regions  (and their subunits) such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the  amgydala, and the hippocampus, as well as their connectivity to cortical regions  such as dorsal medial and lateral prefrontal/cingulate cortex and insula in  maintaining anxiety responding. We discuss how this circuitry might be modulated  by current treatments before finally highlighting areas for future research that  might ultimately improve treatment outcomes for this common and debilitating  transdiagnostic symptom.},

However, animal models are limited when it comes to  understanding the more complex processes of anxiety that are unique to humans  (e.g., worry) and to screen new treatments. In this review, we outline how the  Experimental Psychopathology approach, based on experimental models of anxiety in  healthy subjects, can mitigate these limitations and complement research in  animals. Experimental psychopathology can bridge basic research in animals and  clinical studies, as well as guide and constrain hypotheses about the nature of  psychopathology, treatment mechanisms, and treatment targets. This review begins  with a brief review of the strengths and limitations of animal models before  discussing the need for human models of anxiety, which are especially necessary  to probe higher-order cognitive processes. This can be accomplished by combining  anxiety-induction procedures with tasks that probe clinically relevant processes  to identify neurocircuits that are potentially altered by anxiety. The review  then discusses the validity of experimental psychopathology and introduces a  methodological approach consisting of five steps: (1) select anxiety-relevant  cognitive or behavioral operations and associated tasks, (2) identify the  underlying neurocircuits supporting these operations in healthy controls, 3)  examine the impact of experimental anxiety on the targeted operations in healthy  controls, (4) utilize findings from step 3 to generate hypotheses about  neurocircuit dysfunction in anxious patients, and 5) evaluate treatment  mechanisms and screen novel treatments.

	abstract = {Anxiety is characterized by altered responses under uncertain conditions, but the precise mechanism by which uncertainty changes the behaviour of anxious  individuals is unclear. Here we probe the computational basis of learning under  uncertainty in healthy individuals and individuals suffering from a mix of mood  and anxiety disorders. Participants were asked to choose between four competing  slot machines with fluctuating reward and punishment outcomes during safety and  stress. We predicted that anxious individuals under stress would learn faster  about punishments and exhibit choices that were more affected by those  punishments, thus formalizing our predictions as parameters in reinforcement  learning accounts of behaviour. Overall, the data suggest that anxious  individuals are quicker to update their behaviour in response to negative  outcomes (increased punishment learning rates). When treating anxiety, it may  therefore be more fruitful to encourage anxious individuals to integrate  information over longer horizons when bad things happen, rather than try to blunt  their responses to negative outcomes.},

Several  previous studies have reported relatively poor reliability of amygdala activation  during emotional face processing, a key putative fMRI 'biomarker'. However, the  reliability of amygdala connectivity measures is much less well understood. Here,  we assessed the reliability of task-modulated coupling between three seed regions  (left and right amygdala and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex) and the  dorsomedial frontal/cingulate cortex (DMFC), measured using a psychophysiological  interaction analysis in 29 healthy individuals scanned approximately two weeks  apart. We performed two runs on each day of three different emotional  face-processing tasks: emotion identification, emotion matching, and gender  classification. We tested both between-day reliability and within-day  (between-run) reliability. We found good-to-excellent within-subject reliability  of amygdala-DMFC coupling, both between days (in two tasks), and within day (in  one task). This suggests that disorder-relevant regional coupling may be  sufficiently reliable to be used as a predictor of treatment response or clinical  risk in future clinical studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mood and anxiety disorders are ubiquitous but current treatment options are ineffective for many sufferers. Moreover, a number of promising  pre-clinical interventions have failed to translate into clinical efficacy in  humans. Improved treatments are unlikely without better animal-human  translational pipelines. Here, we translate a rodent measure of negative  affective bias into humans, exploring its relationship with (1) pathological mood  and anxiety symptoms and (2) transient induced anxiety. METHODS: Adult  participants (age = 29 ± 11) who met criteria for mood or anxiety disorder  symptomatology according to a face-to-face neuropsychiatric interview were  included in the symptomatic group. Study 1 included N = 77 (47 = asymptomatic  [female = 21]; 30 = symptomatic [female = 25]), study 2 included N = 47  asymptomatic participants (25 = female). Outcome measures were choice ratios,  reaction times and parameters recovered from a computational model of reaction  time - the drift diffusion model (DDM) - from a two-alternative-forced-choice  task in which ambiguous and unambiguous auditory stimuli were paired with high  and low rewards. RESULTS: Both groups showed over 93\% accuracy on unambiguous  tones indicating intact discrimination, but symptomatic individuals demonstrated  increased negative affective bias on ambiguous tones [proportion high reward =  0.42 (s.d. = 0.14)] relative to asymptomatic individuals [0.53 (s.d. = 0.17)] as  well as a significantly reduced DDM drift rate. No significant effects were  observed for the within-subjects anxiety-induction. CONCLUSIONS: Humans with  pathological anxiety symptoms directly mimic rodents undergoing anxiogenic  manipulation. The lack of sensitivity to transient anxiety suggests the paradigm  might be more sensitive to clinically relevant symptoms. Our results establish a  direct translational pipeline (and candidate therapeutics screen) from negative  affective bias in rodents to pathological mood and anxiety symptoms in humans.},

We discuss how the developmental trajectory of these circuits may  lead to the onset of anxiety during adolescence and, moreover, how effective  pharmacological and psychological treatments may serve to shift the balance of  activity within this circuitry to ameliorate negative bias symptoms.

However, the precise  impact of both transient and pathological anxiety on higher-order cognitive  functions, including short- and long-term memory, is poorly understood. A clearer  understanding of the anxiety-memory relationship is important as one of the core  symptoms of anxiety, most prominently in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),  is intrusive reexperiencing of traumatic events in the form of vivid memories.  This study therefore aimed to examine the impact of induced anxiety (threat of  shock) on memory encoding and retrieval. Eighty-six healthy participants  completed tasks assessing: visuospatial working memory, verbal recognition, face  recognition, and associative memory. Critically, anxiety was manipulated  within-subjects: information was both encoded and retrieved under threat of shock  and safe (no shock) conditions. Results revealed that visuospatial working memory  was enhanced when information was encoded and subsequently retrieved under  threat, and that threat impaired the encoding of faces regardless of the  condition in which it was retrieved. Episodic memory and verbal short-term  recognition were, however, unimpaired. These findings indicate that transient  anxiety in healthy individuals has domain-specific, rather than domain-general,  impacts on memory. Future studies would benefit from expanding these findings  into anxiety disorder patients to delineate the differences between adaptive and  maladaptive responding.},

	abstract = {Anxiety can be an adaptive response to potentially threatening situations. However, if experienced in inappropriate contexts, it can also lead to  pathological and maladaptive anxiety disorders. Experimentally, anxiety can be  induced in healthy individuals using the threat of shock (ToS) paradigm.  Accumulating work with this paradigm suggests that anxiety promotes harm-avoidant  mechanisms through enhanced inhibitory control. However, the specific cognitive  mechanisms underlying anxiety-linked inhibitory control are unclear. Critically,  behavioral inhibition can arise from at least 2 interacting valuation systems:  instrumental (a goal-directed system) and Pavlovian (a "hardwired" reflexive  system). The present study (N = 62) replicated a study showing improved response  inhibition under ToS in healthy participants, and additionally examined the  impact of ToS on aversive and appetitive Pavlovian-instrumental interactions in a  reinforced go/no-go task. When Pavlovian and instrumental systems were in  conflict, ToS increased inhibition to aversive events, while leaving appetitive  interactions unperturbed. We argue that anxiety promotes avoidant behavior in  potentially harmful situations by potentiating aversive Pavlovian reactions  (i.e., promoting avoidance in the face of threats). Critically, such a mechanism  would drive adaptive harm-avoidant behavior in threatening situations where  Pavlovian and instrumental processes are aligned, but at the same time, result in  maladaptive behaviors when misaligned and where instrumental control would be  advantageous. This has important implications for our understanding of the  mechanisms that underlie pathological anxiety. (PsycINFO Database Record},

Experimentally induced stress (via threat of unpredictable shock) improves  accuracy at withholding a response on the sustained attention to response task  (SART), and in separate studies improves accuracy to classify fearful faces,  creating an affective bias. Integrating these findings, participants at two  public science engagement events (n = 46, n = 55) were recruited to explore the  effects of experimentally induced stress on an affective version of the SART. We  hypothesized that we would see an improved accuracy at withholding a response to  affectively congruent stimuli (i.e. increased accuracy at withholding a response  to fearful 'no-go' distractors) under threat of shock. Induced anxiety slowed  reaction time, and at the second event quicker responses were made to fearful  stimuli. However, we did not observe improved inhibition overall during induced  anxiety, and there was no evidence to suggest an interaction between induced  anxiety and stimulus valence on response accuracy. Indeed Bayesian analysis  provided decisive evidence against this hypothesis. We suggest that the presence  of emotional stimuli might make the safe condition more anxiogenic, reducing the  differential between conditions and knocking out any threat-potentiated  improvement.},

Translating this to the clinic relies  on the assumption that blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses in these  regions are stable within individuals. To test this assumption, we scanned a  group of 29 volunteers twice (mean test-retest interval=14.3 days) and calculated  the within-subject reliability of the amplitude of the amygdalae and sgACC BOLD  responses to emotional faces using three paradigms: emotion identification;  emotion matching; and gender classification. We also calculated the reliability  of activation in a control region, the right fusiform face area (FFA). All three  tasks elicited robust group activations in the amygdalae and sgACC (which changed  little on average over scanning sessions), but within-subject reliability was  surprisingly low, despite excellent reliability in the control right FFA region.

However, as for many other psychiatric symptoms the biological  mechanisms underlying avoidance remain unclear.

A total of 101  healthy participants and individuals with mood and anxiety disorders completed an  approach-avoidance go/no-go task under stress induced by threat of unpredictable  shock. RESULTS: We show an increased reliance in the mood and anxiety group on a  parameter of our reinforcement learning model that characterizes a prepotent  (pavlovian) bias to withhold responding in the face of negative outcomes. This  was particularly the case when the mood and anxiety group was under stress.

As a result, anxious individuals often make  decisions that favor harm avoidance. However, this bias could be driven by  enhanced aversion to uncertainty about the decision outcome (e.g., risk) or  aversion to negative outcomes (e.g., loss). Distinguishing between these  possibilities may provide a better cognitive understanding of anxiety disorders  and hence inform treatment strategies. METHODS: To address this question,  unmedicated individuals with pathological anxiety (n = 25) and matched healthy  control subjects (n = 23) completed a gambling task featuring a decision between  a gamble and a safe (certain) option on every trial. Choices on one type of  gamble-involving weighing a potential win against a potential loss (mixed)-could  be driven by both loss and risk aversion, whereas choices on the other  type-featuring only wins (gain only)-were exclusively driven by risk aversion. By  fitting a computational prospect theory model to participants' choices, we were  able to reliably estimate risk and loss aversion and their respective  contribution to gambling decisions. RESULTS: Relative to healthy control  subjects, pathologically anxious participants exhibited enhanced risk aversion  but equivalent levels of loss aversion. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with  pathological anxiety demonstrate clear avoidance biases in their decision making.  These findings suggest that this may be driven by a reduced propensity to take  risks rather than a stronger aversion to losses. This important clarification  suggests that psychological interventions for anxiety should focus on reducing  risk sensitivity rather than reducing sensitivity to negative outcomes per se.},

This study uses the same experimental  design with fMRI and relies on an event-related analysis of BOLD signal changes.  Findings reveal that threat-related cognitive facilitation (improved NoGo  accuracy) is associated with greater activation of a right-lateralized  frontoparietal group of regions previously implicated in sustained attention and  response inhibition. Moreover, these same regions show decreased activation in  the Go trials preceding NoGo errors. During NoGo trials, striatal activity is  also greater in the threat vs safe condition, consistent with the notion of  enhanced inhibitory processing under threat. These findings identify potential  mechanisms by which threat of unpredictable shock can facilitate distinct  cognitive functions. A greater understanding of the complex interaction of the  anxious state and cognitive processes may have critical clinical implications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Laboratory tasks to delineate anxiety disorder features are used to refine classification and inform our understanding of etiological mechanisms. The  present study examines laboratory measures of response inhibition, specifically  the inhibition of a pre-potent motor response, in clinical anxiety. Data on  associations between anxiety and response inhibition remain inconsistent, perhaps  because of dissociable effects of clinical anxiety and experimentally manipulated  state anxiety. Few studies directly assess the independent and interacting  effects of these two anxiety types (state v. disorder) on response inhibition.  The current study accomplished this goal, by manipulating state anxiety in  healthy and clinically anxious individuals while they complete a response  inhibition task. METHOD: The study employs the threat-of-shock paradigm, one of  the best-established manipulations for robustly increasing state anxiety.  Participants included 82 adults (41 healthy; 41 patients with an anxiety  disorder). A go/nogo task with highly frequent go trials was administered during  alternating periods of safety and shock threat. Signal detection theory was used  to quantify response bias and signal-detection sensitivity. RESULTS: There were  independent effects of anxiety and clinical anxiety on response inhibition. In  both groups, heightened anxiety facilitated response inhibition, leading to  reduced nogo commission errors. Compared with the healthy group, clinical anxiety  was associated with excessive response inhibition and increased go omission  errors in both the safe and threat conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Response inhibition  and its impact on go omission errors appear to be a promising behavioral marker  of clinical anxiety. These results have implications for a dimensional view of  clinical anxiety.},

Consistent with our prior findings, shock anticipation facilitated  response inhibition (i.e., reduced errors of commission) on the no-go trials.

	abstract = {Anxiety disorders can be treated both pharmacologically and psychologically, but many individuals either fail to respond to treatment or relapse. Improving  outcomes is difficult, in part because we have incomplete understanding of the  neurobiological mechanisms underlying current treatments. In a sequence of  studies, we have identified 'affective bias-related' amygdala-medial cortical  coupling as a candidate substrate underlying adaptive anxiety (that is, anxiety  elicited by threat of shock in healthy individuals) and shown that it is also  chronically engaged in maladaptive anxiety disorders. We have provided evidence  that this circuit can be modulated pharmacologically, but whether this mechanism  can be shifted by simple psychological instruction is unknown. In this functional  magnetic resonance imaging study, we extend a previously used translational  anxiety induction (threat of shock) in healthy subjects (N=43) and cognitive task  to include an element of instructed attentional control. Replicating our previous  findings, we show that induced anxiety engages 'affective bias-related'  amygdala-dorsal medial frontal coupling during the processing of emotional faces.  By contrast, instructing subjects to attend to neutral shapes (and ignore faces)  disengages this circuitry and increases putative 'attentional control-related'  coupling between the amygdala and a more rostral prefrontal region. These neural  coupling changes are accompanied by corresponding modulation of behavioural  performance. Taken together, these findings serve to further highlight the  potential role of amygdala-medial frontal coupling in the pathogenesis of anxiety  and highlight a mechanism by which it can be modulated via psychological  instructions. This, in turn, generates hypotheses for future work exploring the  mechanisms underlying psychological therapeutic interventions for anxiety.},

In healthy individuals,  experimentally-induced state anxiety or high trait anxiety often results in the  deployment of adaptive harm-avoidant behaviours. However, how these processes  affect cognition is largely unknown. To investigate this question, we implemented  a translational within-subjects anxiety induction, threat of shock, in healthy  participants reporting a wide range of trait anxiety scores. Participants  completed a gambling task, embedded within an emotional working memory task, with  some blocks under unpredictable threat and others safe from shock. Relative to  the safe condition, threat of shock improved recall of threat-congruent (fearful)  face location, especially in highly trait anxious participants. This suggests  that threat boosts working memory for mood-congruent stimuli in vulnerable  individuals, mirroring memory biases in clinical anxiety. By contrast, Bayesian  analysis indicated that gambling decisions were better explained by models that  did not include threat or treat anxiety, suggesting that: (i) higher-level  executive functions are robust to these anxiety manipulations; and (ii) decreased  risk-taking may be specific to pathological anxiety.

Prior work has demonstrated clear impacts of stress  upon basic cognitive function: biasing attention toward unexpected and  potentially threatening information and instantiating a negative affective bias.  However, the impact that these changes have on higher-order, executive,  decision-making processes is unclear. In this study, we examined the impact of a  translational within-subjects stress induction (threat of unpredictable shock) on  two well-established executive decision-making biases: the framing effect (N =  83), and temporal discounting (N = 36). In both studies, we demonstrate (a) clear  subjective effects of stress, and (b) clear executive decision-making biases but  (c) no impact of stress on these decision-making biases. Indeed, Bayes factor  analyses confirmed substantial preference for decision-making models that did not  include stress. We posit that while stress may induce subjective mood change and  alter low-level perceptual and action processes (Robinson et al., 2013c), some  higher-level executive processes remain unperturbed by these impacts. As such,  although stress can induce a transient affective biases and altered mood, these  need not result in poor financial decision-making.},

This  translational circuit, termed the 'aversive amplification circuit', is thought to  drive adaptive, harm-avoidant behavior in threatening environments. Here, in a  natural progression of this prior work, we confirm that this circuit also plays a  role in the pathological manifestation of anxiety disorders. METHODS: Forty-five  unmedicated participants (N=22 generalized and social anxiety disorder/N=23  controls) recruited from Washington DC metropolitan area completed a simple  emotion identification task during functional magnetic resonance imaging at the  National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. FINDINGS: As predicted, a  diagnosis by valence interaction was seen in whole-brain amygdala connectivity  within the dmPFC/ACC clusters identified in our prior study; driven by  significantly greater circuit coupling during fearful versus happy face  processing in anxious, but not healthy, participants. Critically, and in  accordance with contemporary theoretical approaches to psychiatry, circuit  coupling correlated positively with self-reported anxious symptoms, providing  evidence of a continuous circuit-subjective symptomatology relationship.  INTERPRETATION: We track the functional role of a single neural circuit from its  involvement in adaptive threat-biases under stress, to its chronic engagement in  anxiety disorders in the absence of experimentally induced stress. Thus, we  uniquely map a mood and anxiety related circuit across its adaptive and  maladaptive stages. Clinically, this may provide a step towards a more  mechanistic spectrum-based approach to anxiety disorder diagnosis and may  ultimately lead to more targeted treatments.},

Some  individuals are, however, more resilient to the effects of stress than others.  The mechanisms underlying such vulnerability differences are nevertheless  unknown. In this study we attempted to begin quantifying individual differences  in vulnerability by exploring the effect of experimentally induced stress on  decision-making. The threat of unpredictable shock was used to induce stress in  healthy volunteers (N = 47) using a within-subjects, within-session design, and  its impact on a financial decision-making task (the Iowa Gambling Task) was  assessed alongside anxious and depressive symptomatology. As expected,  participants learned to select advantageous decks and avoid disadvantageous  decks. Importantly, we found that stress provoked a pattern of harm-avoidant  behaviour (decreased selection of disadvantageous decks) in individuals with low  levels of trait anxiety. By contrast, individuals with high trait anxiety  demonstrated the opposite pattern: stress-induced risk-seeking (increased  selection of disadvantageous decks). These contrasting influences of stress  depending on mood and anxiety symptoms might provide insight into vulnerability  to common mental illness. In particular, we speculate that those who adopt a more  harm-avoidant strategy may be better able to regulate their exposure to further  environmental stress, reducing their susceptibility to mood and anxiety  disorders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging research has traditionally explored fear and anxiety in response to discrete threat cues (e.g., during fear conditioning). However,  anxiety is a sustained aversive state that can persist in the absence of discrete  threats. Little is known about mechanisms that maintain anxiety states over a  prolonged period. Here, we used a robust translational paradigm (threat of shock)  to induce sustained anxiety. Recent translational work has implicated an  amygdala-prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuit in the maintenance of anxiety in  rodents. To explore the functional homologues of this circuitry in humans, we  used a novel paradigm to examine the impact of sustained anticipatory anxiety on  amygdala-PFC intrinsic connectivity. METHODS: Task-independent fMRI data were  collected in healthy participants during long-duration periods of shock  anticipation and safety. We examined intrinsic functional connectivity. RESULTS:  Our study involved 20 healthy participants. During sustained anxiety, amygdala  activity was positively coupled with dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) activity. High trait  anxiety was associated with increased amygdala-DMPFC coupling. In addition,  induced anxiety was associated with positive coupling between regions involved in  defensive responding, and decreased coupling between regions involved in  emotional control and the default mode network. LIMITATIONS: Inferences regarding  anxious pathology should be made with caution because this study was conducted in  healthy participants. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that anticipatory anxiety  increases intrinsic amygdala-DMPFC coupling and that the DMPFC may serve as a  functional homologue for the rodent prefrontal regions by sustaining anxiety.  Future research may use this defensive neural context to identify biomarkers of  risk for anxious pathology and target these circuits for therapeutic  intervention.},

Specifically, we examine the interaction between anxiety and cognition  focusing on the translational threat of unpredictable shock paradigm; a method  previously used to characterize emotional responses and defensive mechanisms that  is now emerging as valuable tool for examining the interaction between anxiety  and cognition. In particular, we compare the impact of threat of shock on  cognition in humans to that of pathological anxiety disorders. We highlight that  both threat of shock and anxiety disorders promote mechanisms associated with  harm avoidance across multiple levels of cognition (from perception to attention  to learning and executive function)-a "hot" cognitive function which can be both  adaptive and maladaptive depending upon the circumstances. This mechanism comes  at a cost to other functions such as working memory, but leaves some functions,  such as planning, unperturbed. We also highlight a number of cognitive effects  that differ across anxiety disorders and threat of shock. These discrepant  effects are largely seen in "cold" cognitive functions involving control  mechanisms and may reveal boundaries between adaptive (e.g., response to threat)  and maladaptive (e.g., pathological) anxiety. We conclude by raising a number of  unresolved questions regarding the role of anxiety in cognition that may provide  fruitful avenues for future research.},

In line with recent advances demonstrating that negative  affective biases may be driven by specific medial prefrontal-amygdala circuitry,  we asked whether serotonin manipulation can alter affective processing within a  key dorsal medial prefrontal-amygdala circuit: the putative human homologue of  the rodent prelimbic-amygdala circuit or 'aversive amplification' circuit. In a  double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pharmaco-fMRI design, subjects (N=19)  performed a forced-choice face identification task with word distractors in an  fMRI scanner over two separate sessions. On one session subjects received dietary  depletion of the serotonin precursor tryptophan while on the other session they  received a balanced placebo control diet. Results showed that dorsal medial  prefrontal responding was elevated in response to fearful relative to happy faces  under depletion but not placebo. This negative bias under depletion was  accompanied by a corresponding increase in positive dorsal medial  prefrontal-amygdala functional connectivity. We therefore conclude that serotonin  depletion engages a prefrontal-amygdala circuit during the processing of fearful  relative to happy face stimuli. This same 'aversive amplification' circuit is  also engaged during anxiety induced by shock anticipation. As such, serotonergic  projections may inhibit engagement of the 'aversive amplification' circuit and  dysfunction in this projection may contribute to the negative affective bias in  mood and anxiety disorders. These findings thus provide a promising explanation  for the role of serotonin and serotonergic medications in the neurocircuitry of  negative affective bias.},

Despite having  critical implications for daily-living, the precise impact of anxiety on  cognition is as yet poorly quantified. Here we attempt to clarify the impact of  anxiety on sustained attention and response inhibition via a translational  anxiety induction in healthy individuals (N = 22). Specifically, in a  within-subjects design, participants completed the Sustained Attention to  Response Task (SART) in which subjects withhold responses to infrequent no-go  stimuli under threat of unpredictable electrical shock (anxious) and safe  (non-anxious) conditions. Different studies have argued that this task measures  either (1) attention lapses due to off-task thinking or (2) response inhibition;  two cognitive functions which are likely impacted by anxiety. We show that threat  of shock significantly reduces errors of commission on the no-go trials relative  to the safe condition whilst having no effect on go trials or overall reaction  time (RT). We suggest that this is because threat of shock during SART promotes  response inhibition. In particular we argue that, by virtue of frequency,  subjects acquire a habitual bias toward a go response which impairs no-go  performance and that threat of shock improves the ability to withhold these  prepotent responses. This improved response inhibition likely falls within the  range of adaptive cognitive functions which promote cautious harm avoidance under  threatening conditions, although a range of alternative explanations for this  effect is discussed.},

One such mechanism, the detection of a mismatch between  expected and observed outcomes within the ventral striatum (i.e., "prediction  errors"), is thought to be a critical precursor to the formation of new  stimulus-outcome associations. An untested possibility, therefore, is that stress  may affect learning via modulation of this mechanism. Here we combine a  translational model of stress with a cognitive neuroimaging paradigm to  demonstrate that stress significantly increases ventral striatum aversive (but  not appetitive) prediction error signal. This provides a unique account of the  propensity to form threat-related associations under stress with direct  implications for our understanding of both normal stress and stress-related  disorders.},

	abstract = {Serotonin is strongly implicated in the mammalian stress response, but surprisingly little is known about its mode of action. Recent data suggest that  serotonin can inhibit aversive responding in humans, but this remains  underspecified. In particular, data in rodents suggest that global serotonin  depletion may specifically increase long-duration bed nucleus of the stria  terminalis (BNST)-mediated aversive responses (ie, anxiety), but not  short-duration BNST-independent responses (ie, fear). Here, we extend these  findings to humans. In a balanced, placebo-controlled crossover design, healthy  volunteers (n=20) received a controlled diet with and without the serotonin  precursor tryptophan (acute tryptophan depletion; ATD). Aversive states were  indexed by translational acoustic startle measures. Fear and anxiety were  operationally defined as the increase in startle reactivity during short- and  long-duration threat periods evoked by predictable shock (fear-potentiated  startle) and by the context in which the shocks were administered  (anxiety-potentiated startle), respectively. ATD significantly increased  long-duration anxiety-potentiated startle but had no effect on short-duration  fear-potentiated startle. These results suggest that serotonin depletion in  humans selectively increases anxiety but not fear. Current translational  frameworks support the proposition that ATD thus disinhibits dorsal  raphé-originating serotonergic control of corticotropin-releasing  hormone-mediated excitation of the BNST. This generates a candidate  neuropharmacological mechanism by which depleted serotonin may increase response  to sustained threats, alongside clear implications for our understanding of the  manifestation and treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Affective biases may underlie many of the key symptoms of major depressive disorder, from anhedonia to altered cognitive performance.  Understanding the cause of these biases is therefore critical in the quest for  improved treatments. Depression is associated, for example, with a negative  affective bias in reversal learning. However, despite the fact that reversal  learning is associated with striatal response in healthy individuals and  depressed individuals exhibit attenuated striatal function on multiple tasks,  studies to date have not demonstrated striatal involvement in the negative bias  in reversal learning in depression. In this study, the authors sought to  determine whether this may be because reversal learning tasks conventionally used  to study behavior examine reversals only on the basis of unexpected punishment  and therefore do not adequately separate reward- and punishment-based behavior.  METHOD: The authors used functional MRI to compare the hemodynamic response to a  reversal learning task with mixed reward- and punishment-based reversal stages  between individuals with unmedicated major depressive disorder (N=13) and healthy  comparison subjects (N=14). RESULTS: Impaired reward (but not punishment)  reversal accuracy was found alongside attenuated anteroventral striatal response  to unexpected reward in depression. CONCLUSIONS: Attenuated neurophysiological  response of the anteroventral striatum may reflect dysfunction in circuits  involving afferent projections from the orbitofrontal, limbic, and/or  mesostriatal dopaminergic pathways, which conceivably may, together with the  ventral striatum, underlie anhedonia in depression. Learning to appreciate and  enjoy positive life experiences is critical for recovery from depression. This  study pinpoints a neural target for such recovery.},

We have recently shown, for  instance, that anxiety increases the ability to a) detect and b) instigate  defensive responses towards aversive and not appetitive face stimuli in healthy  individuals. This is arguably the key adaptive function of anxiety, yet the  neural circuitry underlying this valence-specific effect is unknown. In the  present translational study, we sought evidence for the proposition that  dorsomedial regions of the prefrontal (DMPFC) and cingulate cortex constitute the  human homologue of the rodent prelimbic and are thus associated with increased  amygdala responding during this adaptive threat bias in anxiety. To this end, we  applied a novel functional connectivity analysis to healthy subjects (N=20)  identifying the emotion of fearful and happy faces in an fMRI scanner under  anxious (threat of unpredictable foot shock) and non-anxious (safe) conditions.  We showed that anxiety significantly increased positive DMPFC-amygdala  connectivity during the processing of fearful faces. This effect was a)  valence-specific (it was not seen for happy faces), b) paralleled by faster  behavioral response to fearful faces, and c) correlated positively with trait  anxiety. As such we provide the first experimental support for an  anxiety-mediated, valence-specific, DMPFC-amygdala aversive amplification  mechanism in healthy humans. This may be homologous to the rodent  prelimbic-amygdala circuit and may, given the relationship with trait anxiety,  underlie vulnerability to anxiety disorders. This study thus pinpoints a key  neural mechanism in adaptive anxiety and highlights its potential link to  maladaptive anxiety.},

Recent animal studies have implicated dopamine in the reinforcement  of stimulus-response habits, as well as in flexible, goal-directed action.  However, the role of dopamine in human action control is still not well  understood. OBJECTIVES: We present the first investigation of the effect of  reducing dopamine function in healthy volunteers on the balance between habitual  and goal-directed action control. METHODS: The dietary intervention of acute  dietary phenylalanine and tyrosine depletion (APTD) was adopted to study the  effects of reduced global dopamine function on action control. Participants were  randomly assigned to either the APTD or placebo group (ns = 14) to allow for a  between-subjects comparison of performance on a novel three-stage experimental  paradigm. In the initial learning phase, participants learned to respond to  different stimuli in order to gain rewarding outcomes. Subsequently, an  outcome-devaluation test and a slips-of-action test were conducted to assess  whether participants were able to flexibly adjust their behaviour to changes in  the desirability of the outcomes. RESULTS: APTD did not prevent stimulus-response  learning, nor did we find evidence for impaired response-outcome learning in the  subsequent outcome-devaluation test. However, when goal-directed and habitual  systems competed for control in the slips-of-action test, APTD tipped the balance  towards habitual control. These findings were restricted to female volunteers.  CONCLUSIONS: We provide direct evidence that the balance between goal-directed  and habitual control in humans is dopamine dependent. The results are discussed  in light of gender differences in dopamine function and psychopathologies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety disorders (ADs) are highly co-morbid, but the reason for this co-morbidity is unclear. One possibility is that they predispose  one another. An informative way to examine interactions between disorders without  the confounds present in patient populations is to manipulate the psychological  processes thought to underlie the pathological states in healthy individuals. In  this study we therefore asked whether a model of the sad mood in depression can  enhance psychophysiological responses (startle) to a model of the anxiety in ADs.  We predicted that sad mood would increase anxious anxiety-potentiated startle  responses. METHOD: In a between-subjects design, participants (n=36) completed  either a sad mood induction procedure (MIP; n=18) or a neutral MIP (n=18).  Startle responses were assessed during short-duration predictable electric shock  conditions (fear-potentiated startle) or long-duration unpredictable threat of  shock conditions (anxiety-potentiated startle). RESULTS: Induced sadness enhanced  anxiety- but not fear-potentiated startle. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides  support for the hypothesis that sadness can increase anxious responding measured  by the affective startle response. This, taken together with prior evidence that  ADs can contribute to depression, provides initial experimental support for the  proposition that ADs and depression are frequently co-morbid because they may be  mutually reinforcing.},

This provided evidence for a valence-specific role of serotonin (which  declines under depleted tryptophan) in aversive processing. Recent theoretical  (Dayan and Huys in PLoS Comput Biol 4:e4, 2008) and experimental (Crockett et al.  in J Neurosci 29:11993-11999, 2009) approaches have, however, further specified  this role by showing that serotonin is critical for punishment-induced  inhibition. OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the role of serotonin in  punishment-induced inhibition. We also examined the impact of induced mood on  this effect to assess whether effects of tryptophan depletion on affective  inhibition are moderated by mood. METHODS: Healthy females consumed a balanced  amino acid mixture with (N = 20) or without (N = 21) the serotonin precursor  tryptophan. Each subject completed either negative or neutral mood induction. All  subjects completed the reward and punishment reversal learning task adopted in  the previous study. RESULTS: We demonstrate a punishment prediction impairment in  individuals who consumed tryptophan which was absent in individuals who were  depleted of tryptophan. This effect was impervious to mood state. CONCLUSIONS:  Our results suggest that serotonin promotes the inhibition of responses to  punishing outcomes. This may lead to reduced punishment prediction accuracy in  the presence of tryptophan and may contribute to resilience to affective  disorders. Reduction of serotonin via tryptophan depletion then removes this  inhibition. As such, we highlight a mechanism by which reduced serotonin can  contribute to disorders of impulsivity and compulsivity as well as disorders of  emotion.},

We have previously shown that both patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy  individuals with low dopamine (DA) synthesis are better at reversal learning  based on punishment than reward. Here, we extend these prior findings by  examining the effects of artificially reducing DA synthesis in healthy  individuals performing this previously employed task. METHODS: In a double-blind,  placebo-controlled crossover design, we applied the acute tyrosine and  phenylalanine depletion (ATPD) procedure to reduce global DA synthesis in 15  female and 14 male subjects. Each subject performed the reward- and  punishment-based reversal-learning paradigm. RESULTS: There was a significant  three-way interaction between ATPD, the valence of the outcome signalling  reversal and the gender of the participants. Examination of punishment and  reward-based reversals separately revealed that this was driven by a significant  improvement in punishment processing in female but not male subjects following DA  depletion. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing DA synthesis in healthy individuals shifted  sensitivity of performance from reward to punishment processing. Gender  differences in DA synthesis might underlie the selectivity of this effect to  female subjects. Such gender biases may go some way towards explaining the gender  biases in certain psychiatric disorders such as depression and Parkinson's  disease.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The majority of individuals who suffer an episode of depression go on to experience recurrences. We have proposed, based upon the observation that  reducing serotonin via acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) is more likely to induce  negative mood in recovered depressed individuals than never depressed  individuals, that this may be because associations form between negative mood and  reduced serotonin during an episode of depression (Robinson and Sahakian, Psychol  Med 38:315-318, 2008b). Such associations would mean that subsequent reductions  in serotonin are more likely to provoke depressed mood and hence trigger an  episode of depression. METHODS: In this study, we tested this hypothesis by  manipulating the mood state of healthy females undergoing ATD (or balanced  placebo) on two separate testing sessions. On the first session, subjects  received either negative or neutral mood induction, while on the second session  all subjects received neutral mood induction. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate  significant ATD-induced negative mood exclusively on the second visit of subjects  who received both ATD and negative mood induction procedure on their first visit.  DISCUSSION: These findings may be explained by the formation of an association  between the negative mood and reduced serotonin states during the first visit. As  such, these findings provide preliminary support for the associative hypothesis  of recurrence in depression. CONCLUSION: Such associations might therefore  explain the discrepancy between the effects of ATD in recovered- and  never-depressed individuals and may, in turn, explain why an episode of  depression increases the risk of subsequent episodes.},

However, evidence also indicates that there can be positive effects of ATD on  both mood and reinforcement processing. Here, we present two separate studies,  with remarkably similar findings, which may help explain these discrepancies. In  both experiments, we assessed cognitive biases following experimentally induced  mood states under both a balanced amino acid drink (BAL) and ATD. A significant  interaction between treatment, mood state and cognitive bias was observed in both  experiments. In the first experiment, subjects undergoing positive mood induction  demonstrated a positive cognitive bias on BAL, which was abolished by ATD. The  same effect was observed in subjects undergoing neutral mood induction in the  second experiment. These effects replicate findings in healthy individuals  undergoing ATD. Subjects undergoing negative mood induction, by contrast,  demonstrated the opposite pattern of results; in both experiments, they showed no  bias under BAL but induction of a positive cognitive bias by ATD. These results  mimic previous findings in currently depressed patients undergoing ATD. We  therefore suggest that mood state moderates the effect of ATD on cognitive  biases. This, in turn, has important implications for the understanding of the  role of 5-HT in psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Affective disorders are associated with altered cognitive performance. However, the precise interaction between affect and cognition is  unclear. The manipulation of serotonin (5-HT), a neurotransmitter implicated in  affect, influences performance on "hot" cognitive tasks that require the  processing of affective stimuli, but manipulation of affect via mood induction  influences performance on "cold" cognitive tasks that do not involve affective  stimuli. We attempted to disentangle the influence of affect on cognition by  examining the effect of manipulating both serotonin (via acute tryptophan  depletion [ATD]) and mood on established hot and cold cognitive tasks. METHODS:  In a double blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, 33 healthy mood-induced  (positive, negative, or neutral) subjects completed the (hot) affective go/no-go  (AGNG) and (cold) one touch tower (OTT) following both placebo and ATD. RESULTS:  Mood influenced performance on the OTT but not AGNG; ATD influenced performance  on the AGNG but not OTT. CONCLUSIONS: A double dissociation was demonstrated  between the influence of ATD and mood on cognition, indicating that serotonin and  mood are not closely linked. We hypothesize that this is due to the differences  between emotions and moods and that aberrant cognition in affective disorders may  be provoked through both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Depressive disorders are amongst the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide and, as such, it is predicted that by 2010 only cardio-ischaemic  disorders will provide a greater burden. In addition to the sizable emotional,  individual and social burden, depressive disorders cost an estimated US\$83.1  billion per year in the United States alone. In spite of effective treatments, a  large proportion of sufferers go on to experience recurrences. With successive  recurrences, the likelihood of subsequent episodes increases. Despite this,  research to date has tended to focus on first episodes or else has not  distinguished between episodes. This editorial review highlights a number of  differences between first and recurrent episodes which, in turn, recommend more  longitudinal, recurrence-oriented, treatments. We also examine the findings from  acute tryptophan depletion studies which, it is speculated, help to understand  the differences between successive episodes. The overall aim, however, is to  highlight the importance of recurrence in depression and to stimulate debate.},

	abstract = {Central serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in emotional and behavioral control processes for many decades, but its precise contribution is not well understood.  We used the acute tryptophan depletion procedure in young healthy volunteers to  test the hypothesis that central 5-HT is critical for predicting punishment. An  observational reversal-learning task was employed that provided separate measures  of punishment and reward prediction. Under baseline, subjects made more  prediction errors for punishment-associated stimuli than for reward-associated  stimuli. This bias was abolished after central 5-HT depletion, which enhanced the  ability to predict punishment while not affecting reward prediction. The  selective potentiation of punishment prediction concurs with recent theorizing,  suggesting that central 5-HT carries a prediction error for future punishment,  but not for future reward (Daw et al, 2002). Furthermore, the finding highlights  the importance of central 5-HT in resilience to adversity and may have  implications for a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and  anxiety.},
